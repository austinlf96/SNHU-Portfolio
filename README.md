### How do I interpret user needs and implement them into a program? How does creating “user stories” help with this?
Interpreting user needs is one of the most valuable skills a programmer can have. It is not uncommon for a customer or client to have an idea of what they want, but not be able to articulate it in terms of programming. Sometimes the requirements can be ambiguous as well, so knowing how to interpret what a user is looking for is essential for creating user stories to implement those features. User stories help with the interpretation and implementation of user needs because they create individual units that can be presented to a client, customer, or user. By sharing user stories with the stakeholders, they can determine what features they require.
### How do I approach developing programs? What agile processes do I hope to incorporate into my future development work?
Program development strategies is an essential skill for a programmer to refine. The way I typically approach developing a program starts with a pen and paper. I have found that writing things down is more flexible than hopping into a word processor, flowchart making software, or editor. I like to map out the essential functions of a program, and then expand on those as I go. In the future, I would like to learn to utilize software like Jira to organize my thoughts and turn the essential functions I map out on paper into user stories. Another agile process I would like to incorporate into my development strategies (and life strategies) is the use of story points to gauge the difficulty of a task. User stories and user points working in tandem could enhance my productivity immensely. 
### What does it mean to be a good team member in software development?
Defining what being a good team member is will undoubtedly vary from person to person and organization to organization. I believe that a good team member in software development will possess the following skills and traits:
- Communication
- Clear coding practices (understandable commenting and variable names)
- Transparency
- Empathy
- Learning mindset

This list will expand as I continue my education and work experience, but I believe these are essential to being a positive member of a development team.
