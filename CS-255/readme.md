## DriverPass Project Summary
The DriverPass Project is a theoretical project for a man named Liam. Liam discovered there is a hole in the market for new driver instruction. Thus, Liam requested an easily accessible system that could provide new drivers with an efficient learning platform. 

## DriverPass Reflection
I did an excellent job identifying fine details about the system design, particularly classes for the UML Class Diagram. The class diagram is as comprehensive as I could get it without delving into coding and beginning the iterative process of refining UML diagrams. 

## Document Revisions
If I were to revise an aspect of the documents included in this repository, I would redesign the login activity diagram. As I explained my notes in the presentation slides, I realized that the login activity diagram did not fully encompass the functionality I would like to implement. For example, the activity diagram does not display any multi-factor authentication steps. Therefore, I would revise the diagram to include multi-factor authentication functionality. 

## Interpretation & Implementation
Interpreting the user's needs is key to creating a successful program. After all, clients know what they want the program to do, not what the users will need to use the product the client wants to present. Therefore, I considered how the users would need to interact within the program regarding calendar appointments, user information, password resets, photo upload options, and what information they could access (the calendar, learning content, payment processing, etc.). It is critical to consider user needs because creating a platform for someone proficient with computer science and the problem-solving strategies associated with the field will not be viable for most users.

## Software Design Approach
There are several strategies and techniques for analyzing and designing systems. I like to begin designing software by making a bullet point list of all the functionality I need to include in a program. Then I want to break that bullet point list down into other bullet point lists that show the necessary components to achieve specific functionality. After a few iterations of that process, I move on to creating diagrams (specifically class diagrams and activity diagrams). Once I've made some visual aids, I like to revisit my bullet list and compare the visual aids to the bullet lists. If something is missing, I will return to the visual aids to update them. Once I've completed the analysis and design phases of the SDLC, I move on to my favorite part: implementation.
